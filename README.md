# CFP - Concurrent functional programming

An monadic interpreter for a functional language that contains channel based communication (a la CSP) and exception handling. The implementation of these two uses (multi-prompt) delimited continuations, and overall the implementation is quite extensible, and other control related constructs can be added without too much effort.

# Running it
`stack run` in the directory will compile the source files and start the interpreter.
